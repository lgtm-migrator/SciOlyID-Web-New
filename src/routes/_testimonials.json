Without SciOlyID, the process of learning, exploring, and familiarizing myself with the various ID event lists would be a much more tedious process. It gamifies the monotonous process of learning all the specimens and makes it fun. I would highly recommend it to anyone who participates in identification events."

		"content": "SciOlyID has been a fantastic tool not only for my learning, but for teaching others. I can pop in during a team member's practice session and give them tips on the specific birds they miss. It's saved all the time I'd normally spend creating a flashcard set; now I can spend even more time honing my ID skills."
